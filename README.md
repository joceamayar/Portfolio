## Installation

#### **1. Understanding the Purpose of Your Portfolio**
   - **Objective**: Your portfolio is a visual representation of your skills and projects. Consider what talents and projects you want to showcase to potential employers or clients.

#### **2. Setting Up Your GitHub Repository**
   - **Creating a Repository**: Go to GitHub, create a new repository named `portfolio`.
   - **Version Control Practices**: Familiarize yourself with Git commands. Regularly commit your changes with clear messages.

#### **3. Local Development Environment**
   - **Software Installation**: Install Git and Visual Studio Code from their official websites.
   - **Cloning Your Repository**: Use `git clone [repository URL]` in your terminal to clone your repository to your local computer.

#### **4. Building Your Portfolio**
   - **HTML Basics**: Structure your HTML with `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<main>`. Here’s a simple structure:
     ```html
     <header>...</header>
     <main>
       <section id="about">...</section>
       <section id="projects">...</section>
       <section id="contact">...</section>
     </main>
     <footer>...</footer>
     ```
   - **CSS Styling**: Link your CSS file in your HTML. Use CSS to style elements, like:
     ```css
     body { font-family: Arial; }
     header { background-color: navy; color: white; }
     ```
   - **Responsive Design**: Make your portfolio mobile-friendly with CSS media queries.

#### **5. Designing Your Portfolio**
   - **Mock-up Creation**: Use tools like Figma to design your portfolio’s layout. Sketch out your ideas on paper first, if you prefer.
   - **Implementing Design**: Convert your mock-up design into HTML and CSS code.

#### **6. Testing and Debugging**
   - **Cross-Browser Testing**: Ensure your portfolio looks good in different web browsers.
   - **Debugging**: Learn to use browser developer tools to troubleshoot and fix issues in your code.

#### **7. Deploying Your Portfolio**
   - **Using GitHub Pages**: Deploy your portfolio for free using GitHub Pages. Follow GitHub’s documentation for deployment steps.
