## Installation

To create a personal portfolio, start by setting up a GitHub repository and cloning it to your local computer using the "git clone" command in the terminal. Utilize Visual Studio Code to create an HTML file and a CSS file within the repository folder.

 Begin building your portfolio by structuring the HTML document with the necessary sections for projects, about me, and contact information. Use HTML tags and add classes or IDs, these will be use in the styling sheet. 
 
 Create a mock-up of your portfolio using Figma or even a pen and paper. Apply CSS styling to the HTML elements based on your design, using properties like font-family, color, and margin. 
 
Once your done commit and push your changes to the GitHub repository and deploy.


## Usage

The utilization of portfolios offers employers or potential customers a comprehensive showcase of an individual's technical knowledge and experience in the field. As a full stack developer, my portfolio allows me to demonstrate proficiency in both front-end and back-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, databases, and server-side programming languages.
